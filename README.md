# BlueJ_Darkmode

What is this?
-------------
This repository stores .css files to be used in the beginner IDE BlueJ.
When installed, BlueJ should adopt the look of the default IntelliJ IDE
theme "Darcula", making it much more pleasant to look at.

How do I install this?
----------------------
Simply copy-paste all .css files from this repository into the stylesheets
folder inside your BlueJ directory (i.e. where BlueJ is installed) and
replace the files that are already there. It is recommended to back up the 
folder before copy-pasting these files, as you'll have to reinstall BlueJ
if you want the normal theme back.

Why is that part bright green/cyan?
----------------------------------
If you find anything in a really bright green-/cyan-ish color, chances
are I colored it like that to find where it applies changes and never found it.
So if you ever find something like that, let me know and I'll see if I
can fix it (if possible with a description of where and how you found it).

Bonus points if you can give me the hex color code with a
color picker, as I "counted through" the color codes from #00FF00
(bright green) to #00FFFF (bright cyan) in certain parts of the code
to make it easier to identify what part of the code needs to be changed.

*Why* would you do this?
